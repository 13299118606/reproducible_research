Web versions of these reproducible papers (mostly based on the Madagascar platform: www.ahay.org) are at 

http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Reproducible_Documents.

One can access the contents of the papers quickly by searching for the title name of each paper in this website.

If you are interested in a particular paper, for example, reproducible_research/drr3d, you can use the following command (first install subversion in a Linux computer) to download it:

svn co https://github.com/chenyk1990/reproducible_research/trunk/drr3d ./drr3d

All sub-directories except for "nonMada" correspond to the reproducible packages (for each paper) based on Madagascar, which means that you can use one command "sftour scons lock && scons paper.pdf" in these sub-directories to reproducible the whole paper in the PDF format.

The "nonMada" sub-directory contains reproducible packages that are not based on Madagascar, e.g., based on Matlab, python, etc.
